Description: Ada package manager.
 A catalog of ready-to-use Ada libraries plus a command-line tool
 (`alr`) to obtain, build, and incorporate them into your own projects.
 It aims to fulfill a similar role to Rust's `cargo` or OCaml's `opam`.
 .
 This is a source package manager, in contrast to apt which is a binary
 package manager.
